- **Library Resolution**: Automatically converts general library names to Context7-compatible IDs
- **Smart Context Injection**: Intelligently parses and injects relevant documentation sections
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Covers thousands of popular libraries and frameworks
- **Real-Time Updates**: Always reflects the latest documentation changes and releases

**Installation & Setup:**
```bash
# Via NPM
npm install @upstash/context7-mcp

# Via Smithery CLI
npx @smithery/cli install @upstash/context7-mcp
```

**Real-World Use Cases:**
- *Learning New Frameworks*: "How do I implement authentication in Next.js 15? use context7"
- *API Integration*: "Show me the latest FastAPI dependency injection patterns use context7"
- *Version Migration*: "What's changed in React 19 hooks compared to React 18? use context7"
- *Best Practices*: "How should I structure Supabase queries in 2025? use context7"
