## Why Your GitHub Profile Matters

Your GitHub profile serves as your digital portfolio in the tech industry. With over 100 million developers on the
platform, standing out requires more than just good codeâ€”you need a profile that tells your story compellingly.
Recruiters spend an average of 6 seconds scanning profiles, making first impressions crucial for career advancement.
